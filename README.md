In this project circuit, we are going to teach you making a superb quality professional amplifier circuit. It a very powerful amplifier circuit that can produce clear and crystal sound in a very cheap price. 

To make this amplifier circuit, we are using DC-12v power supply circuit. The power supply contain 3 ampere. You also can use 12v battery as a power supply circuit. But you should not use High ampere battery.


To make this powerful amplifier circuit, we need to use some electronics components. All components with PCB circuit, you can order from JLCPCB. They offer us best quality pcb circuit in a very cheap price.

TDA-2030 Pinout - 

TDA-2030 is a professional sound IC with 12 watt output power. For this sound IC highest input voltage is 12-28v. 
It’s 5 leg have 5 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st leg non-inverting input, 2nd leg inverting input, 3rd leg –ve, 4th leg O/P and 5th leg +ve.



Connect Resistor with Sound IC - 

To make this amplifier circuit, 1st we connect 18 K Ω resistor with 1no leg of sound IC. Then we connect 680 Ω resistor with 2no leg of sound IC.
To make this amplifier circuit we are using 18 K Ω resistor resistor. We connect another 18 K Ω resistor with 2 and 4no leg of sound IC.
Then we connect the last resistor with this amplifier circuit. We connect 220 Ω resistor with 4no leg of sound IC.



Connect Electrolytic Capacitor with Amplifier - 

Now we need to connect electrolytic capacitor with the amplifier circuit. 1st we connect 1µf/ 50v capacitor with the amplifier circuit. We connect this capacitor positive leg with 1no leg of sound IC.

This time, I’ll connect 10µf/ 50v capacitor with the circuit. We connect this capacitor positive leg with empty terminal of 680 Ω resistor. 
Connect another capacitor positive leg with empty terminal of 220 Ω resistor.



Connect Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor- 

We need to make a parallel connection with mylar polyester film capacitor and 220µf/25v capacitor. We make two pieces parallel connection. 
Now connect capacitor negative leg with 3no leg of sound IC and connect another capacitor positive leg with 5no leg of sound IC.



Make Ground Connection- 

To input ground voltage, we need to make ground connection for this amplifier circuit. We connect all empty leg of resistor and capacitor.
Then cut-off extra leg of all electronics component. 



Connect Audio Input Cable - 

For output audio, 1st we need to input audio at this amplifier circuit. We connect 3.5mm audio input cable ground cable with ground leg of amplifier circuit and connect L/R cable with negative leg of 1µf/ 50v capacitor.



Connect Sound Speaker - 

For output sound, now we need to connect a better quality sound speaker with the amplifier circuit. We connect one speaker cable with ground leg of amplifier and connect another speaker cable with 4no leg of sound IC.



Connect Power Supply - 

Now we connect a power supply adapter with the amplifier circuit. We are using DC-12v (3 amp) power supply with the amplifier circuit. Connect 12v positive cable with 5no leg and negative cable with 3no leg of TDA2030 sound IC.
It is the time to connect sound IC with heat-sink. 

Now just Plug-in 3.5mm audio input cable and power supply with amplifier circuit. Then enjoy the music.
